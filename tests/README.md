# BoxIT Testing Environment

## Overview
This directory contains the Unit test files and **Test directories** used to perform unit tests against the program. For most of the simple tests, temp directories are created and used to assert program's subroutines. 

## Test directories
Subdirectories within the `test directories' are only to be used to assert the program's subroutines and have no meaning in terms of the program's functionality.
